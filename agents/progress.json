      "name": "Embedding/Search: extract to shared embeddingkit library",
      "description": "Goal: extract embedding generation + vector search core into a reusable Go module that both `~/doujins` and `~/hentai0` can consume. Keep domain-specific text composition and API response shapes inside each app, but share: (1) OpenAI-compatible embedding client + model mapping + dims, (2) pgvector/halfvec SQL/query helpers, (3) task table + worker primitives that can be driven by any job system.\n\nName: `embeddingkit` (Go module `github.com/doujins-org/embeddingkit`).\n\n## Scope (what embeddingkit owns)\n\n- Embedding clients\n  - OpenAI-compatible text embedding client (DeepInfra/DashScope base URLs, model mapping, dims, timeouts/retries).\n  - VL embedding interface (URL-only: text + N image/video URLs → ONE vector) behind an abstraction; provider-specific impls live in embeddingkit if stable.\n- Vector storage + query helpers\n  - Canonical pgvector/halfvec helpers (SQL fragments + Bun helpers).\n  - Two-stage retrieval helpers (binary_quantize oversample + halfvec cosine rescoring).\n  - Optional post-processing helpers (MMR/per-series cap).\n- Task/work primitives (optional but recommended)\n  - Generic task tables + repos for “embed entity X with model Y”.\n  - Worker adapters (River adapter provided, but apps may use any job system/cron).\n\n## Non-scope (what stays in apps)\n\n- Domain text templates (how to turn a gallery/video into text) and any per-entity prompt/template logic.\n- Domain routing/API response formats.\n- Domain triggers (what changes require re-embedding); apps enqueue tasks, embeddingkit just provides helpers.\n\n## Tables/migrations contract\n\n- embeddingkit ships Postgres migrations (embedded via embed.FS) for its generic tables (River-style prefixed table names in the host schema):\n  - `embeddingkit_embedding_tasks`\n  - (future) `embeddingkit_entity_embeddings` if we later choose to centralize embedding storage instead of app-owned tables\n  - optional helper views/index helpers if needed\n- Apps run these migrations during their normal migration flow.\n- Embeddings are language-agnostic in storage and search: the same stored vectors are used for multilingual queries.\n\n## Integration contract (how apps interact)\n\nApps provide:\n- DB handle + config (enabled models, dims, oversample factor, schema prefix).\n- Callbacks/interfaces:\n  - `TextDocumentBuilder(entityID) -> string` (language-agnostic)\n  - `AssetLister(entityID) -> []AssetRef` + `AssetFetcher(AssetRef) -> URL` (for VL)\n- Apps enqueue tasks and run a worker loop using either River or any other job system; apps hydrate final entities by ID.\n\nThis is a planning + refactor initiative intended to reduce duplicated logic and keep semantic search behavior consistent across projects.",
